# Kezar Tracker

This is the codebase for a GPS mobile app that displays instantaneous speed; plus lap time, distance, and average speed. Designed for Kezar Track practices by the San Francisco Triathlon Club where workouts consist of laps of different length, speed, and duration.

Currently available mobile apps such as Strava and Runkeeper suffer from some major problems when used during track practice:

   1. They average out speed over the duration of the whole workout.
   1. They do not offer a lap timer.
   1. The speed & lap display are tiny and hard to read while running.
   1. The lap controls are either tiny and hard to activate while running, or non-existent.

Thus, I often have to use both the Strava app and the stopwatch function of the Clock app to follow my workout.

The goal of this app is to provide a super simple running tracker for the SF Tri style of track workouts.
