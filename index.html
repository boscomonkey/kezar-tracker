    <h1>Kezar Tracker Web App</h1>

    <p>GPS running app that displays instantaneous speed; plus lap time, distance, and average speed. Designed for the style of running workouts practiced by the <a href="http://sftriclub.org/">San Francisco Triathlon Club</a> (at <a href="http://bit.ly/1GeLEzy">Kezar Track, Golden Gate Park</a>) composed of non-stop laps of different length, speed, and duration.</p>

    <p>Currently available mobile apps such as Strava and Runkeeper suffer from some major problems for SF Tri style of track practice:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>They average out speed over the duration of the whole workout. Whereas we need instantaneous speed.</li>
      <li>They do not offer a lap timer. Whereas we need to run very specific lap durations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Thus, I often have to use both a running app and a stopwatch app to follow my workout. The goal of this <a href="https://github.com/boscomonkey/kezar-tracker">Kezar Tracker Web App</a> is to provide a super simple running tracker for the SF Tri style of track workouts.</p>

    <p id="startContainer">
      <a href="mobile/www/index.html">
        <button id="startButton">Start</button>
      </a>
